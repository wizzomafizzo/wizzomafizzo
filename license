Hopefully I can make this file serve as an umbrella for all the configs here,
namely all the parts of the configs which I've "borrowed" from people. If I've
taken a whole file and haven't edited it at all you'll probably still have
your copyright notice in it.

You're free to take whatever the hell you want from these files, I don't care,
and even though a mention would be nice, chances are a part of isn't even made
by me.

So far the people I've taken parts from configs are...

xterminus
codemac
dadexter
rezza
